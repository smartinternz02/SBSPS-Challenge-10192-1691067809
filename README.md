Identifying Patterns and Trends in Campus Placement Data using Machine Learning


 where student can estimate their chances of securing on-campus placements, considering several parameters such as Stream, CGPA, Internship, Backlogs and more. Students can estimate their results within few clicks by submitting short form. The website usage the machine learning model to analyze the input parameters. The dataset downloaded from the www.Kaggle.com for testing.


## Features:
- By leveraging the Decision Tree Classification technique, the model has been train to analyze the input parameteers and makes predictions ragarding the outcome.
- The Machine Learing Model (Decision Tree Classification) achieved 97% precision and 86% accuracy.

## Tech Stack:
- HTML, CSS, Python.
- Flask framework.
- Jupyter Notebook.
- IBM cloud and ibm watson studio
